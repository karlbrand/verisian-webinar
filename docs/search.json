    "section": "Surya’s Challenges in 2024",
    "text": "Surya’s Challenges in 2024\nLegacy Processes: 2024 or 1994? [as-is]\n\nData Storage\nData Transformation\nProcesses: the solo programmer & double programming\nSilo everything: challenges unique to the Domain (data privacy):  Data and code and tools are closed source \n\n\n\nFirst: there is the data. This typically arrives at Surya’s teams desks as flat-files of tables locked up in a proprietary file format like sas7bdat archive files. And not just one file, but many. And not with unique feature or variable sets but with redundancy. And with a set of variables or ‘data models’ which differ between studies and over time.\nCountless hours have been invested to create standards to ease interoperability across studies, teams companies and so forth: CDISC Analysis Data Model (CDISC - ADaM) and Study Data Tabulation Model (CDISC - STDM)\nWhere are these files stored? Probably on a network file share. In a mostly, but entirely, standardised (but arcane) folder hierarchy. Invented by a sys-admin who knows linux, but not UX.\nSurya will need some days, or weeks, to familiarize her self with the mere structure of the study data.\nSecond: there is what we do to the data. Surya transforms some variables from one format to another according to a set of specifications another team drafted. This may be units of measurement, different international standards for certain data types like dates, and so forth. In computer science this might be akin to the ‘T’ for ‘transformation’ in the ETL process. Some excellent software developed for ETL applications. But manual writing and maintenance of SAS code is not one them!\nSurya will toil for some days or weeks on the code that manages the transformation of the clinical trial data her team is supporting.\nThird: Surya will deal with the first two challenges alone. That is, navigating the study files on the network drive, the countless SAS programs and macros already written, and of course writing what ever changes, updates or new SAS programs are defined in the documentation for this specific study, like the Statistical Analysis Plan or SAP.\nOn top of doing this alone, a second human will re-write, from scratch much or all of the code Surya wrote to create the tables, listings and figures for the CSR. If both programmers code produce the same out-put it means that they either both did it correctly, or they both made the same mistake. Fair enough, it’s almost always the correct out come. But it’s a lot of energy with no gain beyond a consensus is programming.\nFourth and last in my misery-list are challenges unique to the domain of itself. Namely data privacy owing to the source of the data: us. These are measurements about our most intimate selves. I’m a pretty person but even I’m not comfortable advertising certain measurements of my body. No doubt your the same. This means a LOT of resources are invested to ensure clinical data is held under strictly enforced access controls.\nStewart Brand (no relation) was quoted: “Information wants to be free”. It seams he was not referring to clinical data.\nIn contrast to the virtues of the open-source movement which has delivered much of the tooling needed to build, arguable, humanities greatest achievement to date - the internet - the justifiable siloing of clinical data has seeded the approach I think, that everything around it should also be carefully guarded and locked away: the code we write to do the data processing, the langauge we use to write the code (still mostly SAS), the systems we use, Oracle, SAP and so forth. So before a single byte of patient data arrives, we’ve spent many millions of dollars on hidden technologies to support our work with it. A closed shop.\nGood luck Surya learning how to work with these systems in University. More likely she is learning on the job, subtracting her time to learn from the bottom line of her company and adding to the waiting time for a patient in need of the medicine.\nso that’s the bad and the ugly of clinical programming in 2024.\n\n-But I’m an optimist, and see the solutions all around us… namely from the software development industry. Because, you know, they write code to do useful, or at least valuable things for all of us, like letting me speak from the comfort of my home office to all of your selves, in real time!"

    "text": "Learn from the best\nThe software dev / tech industry[to-be]\n\nVersion control: code and data\nAgile development methods: collaboration and iteration\nOpenish source: democratize the tools and processes that we use to make money with, not from. SAS macros anyone? \nAnd make our data accessible to anyone who can add value: data scientists, shareholders, regulators, at any-time, any-how. Blockchain anyone?\n\n\n\nalthough mainstream software dev doesn’t need to worry about audits from regulatory authorities, or harm coming to patients, there are some pretty obvious tools that clinical programming from day 1 of go live:\nFirst: let’s let the machines look after versioning our code. Yes, SVN or perhaps Git is in place in companies, but statistical programmers are typically not committing, branching and merging the code they write. SAS code is still written more like a word document on a university students PC, using directory and file names to indicate code history and maturity.\nThe same is true for data in my experience. What else would Surya expect from using files to store data. Even if we were insane we could get these ‘files’ into a git repo and improve the management of our data and clinical study progress to completion. I’m half joking, just snap-shotting any common relational database would provide large efficiency gains from process perspective. These products are available today, e.g. TerminusDB, Dolt and LakeFS look very interesting.\nAgile development: this is a pet love of mine. Developers have been writing code since before most of us were born. It’s a hard job, but after 50 years these clever people have worked out some pretty effective ways to generate the highes quality code with as little time and energy as possible.\n\npair programming\ntest driven development\nsprint cycles: iteration, iteration and more iteration!\nstand ups\ncode reviews\nback log refinements\nstory board estimates\n\nit all works!\nstat programming is really missing a lot merely not embracing current software dev best practices… especially given the pressures of the regulatory environment.\n\nAnd third is a mind-set shift around our main assets. Keeping our compound structures and synthesis processes secret and under patent should remain so. But the data we receive from our patients realizes new value in the ‘data is the new oil’ economy."

Over the last quarter century or so hundreds of millions have been plouged into building and maintaining the SAS pipelines that Surya and her team use to create TLFs. The external companies and internal stake-holders that support this are incentivised to keep doing so. They want to keep doing what they know how to do. Learning new tricks get’s harder the longer you keep doing the same thing.\nNext is the industries legacy of being closed source. The silo everything mentality works against change and innovation. Whatever we do, we typically do alone because of the pervading atmosphere of ‘don’t tell any one’.\nSo except for cross industry organisations like PHUSE and CDISC we largely miss the collective intelligence of developers exchanging and building on great ideas to advance the field.\nLethargy pervades teams: get the work done, don’t create more by trying to innovate.\nSo unlike other less profitable industries we see a rate of change yet matching our species: only the younger generation, with newer experiences and views on the world who are given the opportunity to lead will make the changes required for improvement.\nThe reality is that managers in large companies with high salaries and benefits are incentivised to stay in place and not try to fix what isn’t broken.\nThe fourth point is a doozy: the sheer volume and interdependent architecture of a typical phase 2 or 3 study is something to behold. If you could behold it. Because as of today there is no tool available you can point to a study code base which will describe, in total, the dependency tree, or map of every single clinical variable or feature.\nMacros nested within macros nested within macros, tables inner joined, outer joined, left and right joined from multiple files containers.\nIs it any wonder stat programming pays as well as it does to have a human understand this?\n Note that I said ‘until today’. We’ll come back to this.\nLast point, let’s be honest: energy is only spent when the motivation is sufficient."

That’s all you need.       -Marcus Aurelius\n\n\n\n\nI would have thought these two points are obvious.\nBut from those making the decisions with access to the big budgets, I’m not seeing the evidence that these 2000 year old points have been grasped…\nNow, lets what do I propose we can and should we do today to narrow the gap between the as-is and to-be."
